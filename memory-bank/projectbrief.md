# Project Brief: Grub

## Project Overview

Grub is an application designed to reduce food waste by connecting consumers with bakeries and supermarkets to purchase unsold or leftover food at discounted prices. The application focuses on food items approaching their expiration date, which would otherwise be discarded.

## Core Objectives

- Reduce food waste from bakeries and supermarkets
- Provide consumers with access to affordable food options
- Create a sustainable business model that benefits all parties involved

## Target Audience

- **Consumers:** People who want to buy cheaper foods but don't mind purchasing items that will expire soon, as they plan to consume them quickly
- **Businesses:** Bakeries and supermarkets with excess inventory at the end of day/approaching expiry dates

## Key Features

### For Consumers:

- Reserve food items at discounted prices
- Discover available food bundles/items near them
- Reputation system (users who don't pick up reserved items receive negative ratings)

### For Bakeries:

- List bundles, bread, prices, discounted prices
- Set sales periods and available pickup periods
- Access mockup ML suggestions for optimal production quantities based on historical data

### For Supermarkets:

- Standard interface for listing products
- API integration options for publishing items on the app

## Business Model

- **Consumers:** Get food at significantly discounted prices (e.g., mystery bags at 50% off retail value)
- **Businesses:** Generate revenue from food that would otherwise be wasted
- **Environment:** Reduce food waste contributing to sustainability goals (SDGs)

## Example Use Case

A local bakery has 10 unsold bread loaves at the end of the day. Rather than discarding them:

1. Bakery lists them on Grub as a "mystery bag" at 50% discount
2. User reserves the mystery bag through the app
3. User picks up the bag during the designated pickup period
4. Bakery reduces waste and still earns revenue
5. User gets bread at a significant discount

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in food waste from participating businesses
- Number of active users
- Number of completed reservations
- Business retention and engagement
