# Product Context: Grub

## Why This Project Exists

Grub exists to address three interconnected problems:

1. **Food Waste Crisis**: Approximately one-third of all food produced globally is wasted. Bakeries and supermarkets regularly discard unsold items that are still perfectly edible but approaching their expiration dates.

2. **Food Affordability**: Many consumers struggle with the rising cost of food. There's a market need for more affordable options without compromising quality.

3. **Sustainability Goals**: Businesses are increasingly expected to adopt sustainable practices. Reducing food waste is a tangible way for food retailers to demonstrate environmental responsibility.

### For Businesses:

- **Revenue Recovery**: Converts potential waste into revenue
- **Waste Reduction**: Decreases disposal costs and environmental footprint
- **Customer Acquisition**: Attracts new customers who may not have shopped there otherwise
